## [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even
every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python's most noteworthly features,
and will give you a good idea of the language's flavor and style.

### 1. Whetting Your Appetite

#### 1.1 What Python can do?

Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large
programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer.

The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning
with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching upon
advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.

#### 1.2 Python Installing

Download python installer from [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)ï¼Œinstall Python as prompted.
Open terminal type `python3` to see if installed successfully.

```

Everythin is OK, celebration!
