# machine_learning
Machine learning from the ground up

As machine learning becomes popular, more and more people want to switch to the machine learning
industry in order to stay at the forefront of the times and obtain higher prospects or income.

But getting started with machine learning is not as simple as traditional programming. It
involves a lot of mathematical knowledge and engineering practices. This tutorial is designed to
break down these boundaries and is intended for those with only a high school background.

Before writing the simplest neural network, you need to be proficient in writing Python code, as
well as a lot of mathematical background, especially derivatives and matrices.

This tutorial is mainly divided into three parts: the first part is prerequisites, mainly solving
programming and mathematical problems; the second part is the basics of machine learning, writing
neural networks from scratch, training simple data, and comprehensively understanding the
TensorFlow library; the third part is to follow the industry cutting-edge, such as learning
large language models and reading relevant papers.

If your English is not good, it is recommended that you start by learning English first, because
many materials come from the English-speaking world. If some people pay attention to this tutorial,
I will consider opening a YouTube channel to explain it.

There's a lot more to say, but if you want to learn, just follow the tutorial and get started. This
will be a difficult journey, and you will gain a lot. Perhaps you will find that machine learning is
not that mysterious after all. Then I wish you success.

## Prerequisite

### [Python](python)

Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.
Mainly divided into three parts for learning:

(1) The Python tutorial

This tutorial refers to the official tutorial [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
which will allow you to write Python code quickly. Practice makes perfect and requires
continuous practice in subsequent studies.

- [x] Whetting Your Appetite
- [x] Using the Python Interpreter
- [x] An Informal Introduction to Python
- [x] More Control Flow Tools
- [x] Data Structures
- [x] Modules and Packages
- [x] Import and Output
- [x] Classes
- [x] Errors and Exceptions

(2) Python Standard Library

Only select common and important content for introduction. For comprehensive information, please
refer to the official website [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html).

- [x] Brief Tour of the Standard Library (I)
- [ ] Brief Tour of the Standard Library (II)

(3) Third-party library

Mainly select libraries related to machine learning for introduction to consolidate the Python
tutorials learned previously.

- [ ] [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python
- [ ] [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Visualization with Python

### [Math](math)

Machine learning involves a large amount of mathematical knowledge, among which calculus,
linear algebra, and probability theory are particularly important. The following is divided
into four parts:

(1) Precalculus

- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Linear Functions
- [ ] Polynomial and Rational Functions
- [ ] Exponential and Logarithmic Functions
- [ ] Trigonometric Functions
- [ ] Periodic Functions
- [ ] Trigonometric Identities and Equations
- [ ] Further Applications of Trigonometry
- [ ] Systems of Equations and Inequalities
- [ ] Analytic Geometry
- [ ] Sequences, Probability and Counting Theory
- [ ] Introduction to Calculus 

(2) Calculus

Calculus uses the textbook provided by [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/), which contains three
volumes in total. It guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them
understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them.

Calculus I

- [ ] Functions and Graphs
- [ ] Limits
- [ ] Derivatives
- [ ] Applications of Derivatives
- [ ] Integration
- [ ] Application of Integration

Calculus II

- [ ] Techniques of Integration
- [ ] Introduction to Differential Equations
- [ ] Sequences and Series
- [ ] Power Series
- [ ] Parametric Equations and Polar

Calculus III

- [ ] Vectors in Space
- [ ] Vector-Valued Functions
- [ ] Differentitation of Functions of Several Variables
- [ ] Multiple Integration
- [ ] Vector Calculus
- [ ] Second-Order Differential Equations

## Basic of Machine Learning

It is mainly written with reference to the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
official website and the book [Deep Learning with Python](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks),
which comprehensively covers the basic content of machine learning.
